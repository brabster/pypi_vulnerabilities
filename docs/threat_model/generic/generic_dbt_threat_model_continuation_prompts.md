# User Prompts for Gemini: Updating the dbt-core Threat Model Template

**Objective:** To guide Gemini in facilitating an interactive session to update the "Generic Threat Model Template for dbt-core Usage," reflecting changes to dbt-core, its common usage patterns, or newly identified generic threats. The process should adhere to the style, instructions, and corrections from our session ending 2025-05-14.

**Instructions for User (You):**
* Provide these prompts to Gemini at the start of and throughout the template update session.
* Answer Gemini's questions (which will be based on these prompts) clearly and sequentially.
* Have the existing "Generic Threat Model Template for dbt-core Usage" (Version 1.0, dated 2025-05-14, or latest version) available for reference.

## Phase 0: Session Setup & Style Instructions (User to Gemini)

**User Prompt to Gemini (at the start of the new session):**
"Hi Gemini, we're going to update the 'Generic Threat Model Template for dbt-core Usage.' I'd like you to act as my security coach and guide me through this update process, similar to our session on 2025-05-14. Please adhere to the following guidelines throughout this session:
1.  **Interactive Coaching Style:** Ask me questions to help me think through the necessary updates to the template.
2.  **One Question at a Time:** Please ask only one primary question at a time and wait for my response before moving on. Number your questions for clarity.
3.  **Diagrams (if applicable):**
    * If we need to update or create new diagrams (e.g., the DFD), we will use **GitHub-compliant Mermaid syntax**.
    * Ensure all Mermaid syntax is correct (e.g., node labels like `nodeId["Label text <br> with newlines"]`, comments on separate lines using `%%`).
    * For node identifiers, I prefer descriptive camelCase names.
4.  **Output Format:** All textual updates to the template should be provided directly as **GitHub-compliant Markdown**. Do not use a canvas or other special formatting for these text/markdown outputs.
5.  **Focus:** Our goal is to update the *generic template*, not to perform a threat model for a specific application.
6.  **My Role:** I will provide information about the changes or new considerations for `dbt-core` and will review the updated template sections you help me draft."

## Phase 1: Understanding the Need for Template Update (User to Gemini)

**User Prompt to Gemini:** "Let's start by understanding why the template needs an update. Please ask me the following, one numbered question at a time:"
* "1.1 What specific changes in `dbt-core` itself, its common usage patterns, newly identified generic vulnerabilities, or best practices necessitate an update to our 'Generic Threat Model Template for dbt-core Usage' (Version 1.0, dated 2025-05-14)?"
* "1.2 Which sections of the existing template do I anticipate these changes will most likely affect?"

---

## Phase 2: Reviewing and Updating Template Sections (User to Gemini)

**User Prompt to Gemini:** "Now, let's go through the existing template section by section and discuss necessary updates based on the changes we just identified. For each section, please prompt me to consider if updates are needed and help me draft them."

* "2.1 **Section 1: Introduction**
    * Prompt me: 'Does the **Purpose of this Template** (1.1), **Scope** (1.2), **Target Audience** (1.3), or **General Assumptions** (1.4) need to be revised based on the recent changes or new understanding of `dbt-core` usage?'
    * If yes, ask: 'What specific modifications or additions should we make to these subsections?'"

* "2.2 **Section 2: Typical dbt-core Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**
    * Prompt me: 'Does the existing DFD (or any other diagrams) need to be updated to reflect new common interaction patterns, components, or data flows relevant to generic `dbt-core` usage?'
    * If yes, ask: 'What specific changes should we make to the Mermaid diagram? Let's iterate on the code.'
    * Prompt me: 'Do the **DFD Element Descriptions** need updating to match any diagram changes or new terminology?'"

* "2.3 **Section 3: Potential Threat Areas and Considerations**
    * Prompt me: 'Reviewing the existing subsections (3.1 to 3.7, e.g., Configuration Management, Project Code Integrity, Dependency Management, CI/CD, etc.):
        * Are there any *new generic threat areas* we should add to this section based on recent `dbt-core` changes or observed risks?'
        * For each existing subsection, do the example **Considerations**, **Example Threats**, or **Example Mitigations** need to be updated to reflect new best practices or risks associated with `dbt-core`?'
    * If updates are needed, ask: 'What specific additions or modifications should we make to these parts of Section 3?'"

* "2.4 **Section 4: Threat Prioritization and Mitigation Planning (Guidance)**
    * Prompt me: 'Does the guidance provided in this section, or the example threat table structure, need any adjustments to better guide users of the template in light of new `dbt-core` considerations?'"

* "2.5 **Section 5: Review and Maintenance**
    * Prompt me: 'Does the advice on reviewing and maintaining the threat model (created from this template) need any updates?'"

## Phase 3: Drafting and Finalizing Template Updates (User to Gemini)

**User Prompt to Gemini:**
* "3.1 As we discuss updates for each section, please draft the revised text directly in GitHub-compliant Markdown. Present updated diagrams in compliant Mermaid code."
* "3.2 After drafting the changes for a major section, please ask for my review of that specific section before we move to the next."

## Phase 4: Review and Conclude Template Update Session (User to Gemini)

**User Prompt to Gemini:** "Once all sections have been reviewed and updated:"
* "4.1 Please present the complete, updated 'Generic Threat Model Template for dbt-core Usage' document in a single, clean Markdown output."
* "4.2 Ask me to do a final review of the entire updated template for accuracy, clarity, and completeness."
* "4.3 Ask if there are any outstanding points or if we can formally conclude this template update session."
* "4.4 Remind me to update the version number and 'Last Updated' date in the template."
